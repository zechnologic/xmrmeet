    "mission": "XMR Meet is an open-source, community-driven platform for Monero enthusiasts who enjoy connecting with others in person to exchange Monero and cash. We're a simple directory for hobbyists who want to discover fellow community members in their area and engage in casual, peer-to-peer exchanges.",

        "title": "Making Monero Real",
        "text": "Cryptocurrency becomes truly powerful when it moves beyond digital wallets and into the real world. XMR Meet exists to bridge that gap - to make Monero more dynamic, more tangible, and more accessible to everyday people. When you can meet someone at a local café and exchange cash for XMR, it stops being just numbers on a screen and becomes real money."

      "fightingDelistings": {
        "title": "Fighting Exchange Delistings",
        "text": "As more exchanges delist Monero due to regulatory pressure, peer-to-peer networks become increasingly important. XMR Meet empowers the community to create its own liquidity, independent of centralized platforms. You don't need an exchange when you have neighbors who believe in financial privacy."

      "buildingAdoption": {
        "title": "Building Real Adoption",
        "text": "For XMR holders who want to see the price go up - and let's be honest, we all do - there's no better strategy than real-world usage. The more people actively using and exchanging Monero in their daily lives, the more it behaves like an actual currency rather than just a speculative asset. Real adoption drives real value. Every local meetup, every in-person exchange, every new user who discovers XMR through a friendly face instead of a corporate interface - that's what makes the network stronger and more resilient."

      "community": {
        "title": "Community Over Corporations",
        "text": "Monero was built on principles of decentralization and privacy. XMR Meet extends those principles to the way we acquire and exchange it. No KYC, no corporate middlemen, no surveillance - just people connecting with people. This is how peer-to-peer currency was always meant to work."
