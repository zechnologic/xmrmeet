# XMR Meet

**XMR Meet** is an open-source, community-driven platform for Monero enthusiasts who enjoy connecting with others **in person to exchange Monero and cash**. The website is designed for hobbyists and enthusiasts to discover fellow community members in their area who are open to casual, in-person exchanges.

This project is built for **fun, education, and community engagement**—a simple way to see who’s around, share your interest in meeting up, and connect with like-minded peers who enjoy exchanging value in person.

## How It Works

- Users can create a profile and indicate:

  - Their city or general location
  - Whether they are available to exchange **Monero for cash, cash for Monero, or both**

- All communication and meetup details happen **offline**, via any third-party messaging service (Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, email, etc.). XMR Meet is just a directory for those interested in meeting up—it does not handle trades directly.

- The platform does **not** facilitate pricing, trading rates, or commercial transactions. It’s purely for hobbyists who enjoy **in-person P2P exchanges as a fun, community activity**.

## Features

- Quickly see who in your area is open to casual Monero-cash exchanges
- Open-source and freely available under the **AGPLv3 License**

# XMR Meet: Rules & Safety Guide

XMR Meet is for Monero enthusiasts who enjoy casual, in-person exchanges. While the platform is for fun and community, personal safety should always come first. Follow these guidelines to make your meetups safe, secure, and enjoyable.

## General Safety

- **Meet in public, busy places**: Parks, cafés, co-working spaces, or shopping areas are ideal. Avoid secluded locations, parking lots, or private homes for first-time meetings.
- **Daytime is best**: If possible, schedule meetups during daylight hours when visibility is higher and more people are around.
- **Bring a friend**: Let someone know where you’re going and who you’re meeting. If you can, bring a trusted friend along for your first meetup.
- **Stay alert**: Keep your phone accessible, be aware of your surroundings, and trust your instincts. If something feels off, cancel or leave.
- **Limit distractions**: Avoid headphones or being too engrossed in your phone during the meetup.

## Transaction Limits & Handling

- **Start small**: For first-time meetups, keep transactions under $300 USD worth of Monero. Gradually increase amounts once trust is established.
- **Count and verify cash discreetly**: Ensure both parties agree on the amount before completing the exchange.
- **Verify Monero transfers**: Double-check wallet addresses and amounts. Confirm transactions have been completed before handing over cash.
- **Separate your funds**: Don’t carry more cash or Monero than necessary for a single meetup.

## Communication & Planning

- **Use secure messaging apps**: Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, or email. Avoid sharing sensitive info publicly.
- **Confirm details before meeting**: Double-check location, time, and amount. Consider sending a photo of the meetup spot if needed.
- **Have a backup plan**: Agree on what to do if one party is late or cancels.

## Street-Smart Tips

- **Scout the location first**: Check the area for safety, foot traffic, and exit routes.
- **Sit near exits**: In cafés or public spaces, pick a table near the door or in clear view of staff.
- **Be aware of surroundings**: Keep an eye out for suspicious behavior or anyone following you.
- **Limit personal info**: Only share what’s necessary for the meetup. Avoid giving your home address or sensitive identifiers.
- **Use cash wisely**: Don’t flash large bills; keep it discreet.
- **Split large transactions**: For repeat meetups, break larger amounts into smaller transactions for safety.
- **Park smart**: If driving, park in well-lit areas with visibility from the street.

## Building Trust

- **Start with small amounts**: Test the process before committing to larger exchanges.
- **Repeat meetups**: Trust builds over time—don’t feel pressured to transact large amounts immediately.
- **Reference mutual contacts if possible**: If you have community connections, it can help establish credibility.
