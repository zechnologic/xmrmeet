# XMR Meet

**XMR Meet** is an open-source, community-driven platform for Monero enthusiasts who enjoy connecting with others **in person to exchange Monero and cash**. The website is designed for hobbyists and enthusiasts to discover fellow community members in their area who are open to casual, in-person exchanges.

This project is built for **fun, education, and community engagement**—a simple way to see who’s around, share your interest in meeting up, and connect with like-minded peers who enjoy exchanging value in person.

## How It Works

- Users can create a profile and indicate:

  - Their city or general location
  - Whether they are available to exchange **Monero for cash, cash for Monero, or both**

- All communication and meetup details happen **offline**, via any third-party messaging service (Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, email, etc.). XMR Meet is just a directory for those interested in meeting up—it does not handle trades directly.

- The platform does **not** facilitate pricing, trading rates, or commercial transactions. It’s purely for hobbyists who enjoy **in-person P2P exchanges as a fun, community activity**.

## Features
